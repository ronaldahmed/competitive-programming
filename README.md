<h1>Code and templates</h1>
<p>This repository contains templates, notebooks, and code for competitive programming contests like ACM ICPC.</p>
<p>The material spans a wide range of algorithmic design complexity, from sorting to network flows, advanced data structures, and computational geometry. All the algorithms and solved problems use standard libraries allowed in ACM ICPC-like competences.</p>
